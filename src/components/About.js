            <p>
            I am a Fullstack software developer. I write C Sharp, which I use to develop
            web applications. I am very good with Asp.Net core framework, entity frameworkcore
            web api.
            I have interest in frontend development, which made me to be interested in React.
            I see React as a library I can flow with easily, and it will also enable me to dive into 
            mobile app development using React Native. With React, I will also be able to write 
            Solidity because I have interest in BlockChain development.
